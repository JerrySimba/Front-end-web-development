# Front-end repository
This repository is all about Front end with HTML, JS, React and CSS.
It summarises all the properties available when I was doing my study and I can say its very much all you need to know as others come with time. I found them handy and useful. It contains: 
        1. Responsive hamburger menu with additional snipets
        2. Login landing page
        3. Dropdown page
        4. Google homepage
        5. a calculator design with HTML and CSS (the functional version is coming shortly with JS)
        6. Food menu
